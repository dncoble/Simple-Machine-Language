This Program is able to both:
1. compile SIMPLE language code into SML machine code
2. run SML machine code

In order to both run and compile a program, two excecutions of the code is required.



Usage Instructions:
When running the program, you will be prompted if you want to read or compile a program.
to run a machine code file type: "r" (enter)
to compile a SIMPLE program into machine code type instead: "c" (enter)

Next type the name of the file you wish to run or compile.
Ex: "filename.txt" (enter)

If you are compliling a file, you will then be asked to type in a file name.
Ex:  "compiledfile.txt" (enter)
