This Program is able to both:
1. compile SIMPLE language code into SML machine code
2. run SML machine code

## Usage Instructions
In order to both run and compile a program, two excecutions of the code is required. When running the program, you will be prompted if you want to read or compile a program. To run a machine code file type: `r` (enter), to compile a SIMPLE program into machine code type instead: `c` (enter).

Next type the name of the file you wish to run or compile.
Ex: `filename.txt` (enter)

If you are compliling a file, you will then be asked to type in a file name.
Ex:  `compiledfile.txt` (enter)
